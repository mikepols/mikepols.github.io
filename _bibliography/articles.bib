  abstract = {Phonons in chiral crystal structures can be circularly polarized, making them chiral. Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily form chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result, they exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and the spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density functional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a potential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality. Under a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular momentum, leading to experimentally observable effects. These findings position chiral 2D perovskites as a promising platform for exploring the interplay among phononic, electronic, spintronic, and thermal properties.},

Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI\(_{3}\) as a case study, we develop machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI\(_{3}\). We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.},

However, their air/water instability, combined with their toxicity, is still a critical problem that has slowed down their commercialization. In this sense, bismuth-based halide derivatives attract much interest as a potentially safer, air-stable alternative. Herein, a novel Bi-based perovskite-inspired material, IEF-19 (IEF stands for IMDEA Energy Framework), which contains a bulky aromatic cation (1,5-diammonium naphthalene), is prepared. Additionally, an N-alkylation strategy is successfully employed to achieve four water-stable perovskite-inspired materials, which contains diammonium naphthalene cations that are tetra-alkylated by methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl groups. Moreover, computational studies are performed to gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic structural stability and affinity of water molecules for Bi-based perovskite-inspired materials. Importantly, the air- and water-stable IEF-19-Et (i.e., stable at least 12 months under ambient conditions and 3 weeks in contact with water) is found to be an active photocatalyst for vapor-phase overall water splitting in the absence of any sacrificial agent under both ultraviolet--visible or simulated sunlight irradiation. This material exhibits an estimated apparent quantum yield of 0.08% at 400 nm, partially explained by its adequate energy band level diagram.},

  abstract = {All-inorganic halide perovskites have received a great deal of attention as attractive alternatives to overcome the stability issues of hybrid halide perovskites that are commonly associated with organic cations. To find a compromise between the optoelectronic properties of CsPbI\(_{3}\) and CsPbBr\(_{3}\), perovskites with CsPb(Br\(_{x}\)I\(_{1-x}\))\(_{3}\) mixed compositions are commonly used. An additional benefit is that without sacrificing the optoelectronic properties for applications such as solar cells or light-emitting diodes, small amounts of Br in CsPbI\(_{3}\) can prevent the inorganic perovskite from degrading to a photo-inactive non-perovskite yellow phase. Despite indications that strain in the perovskite lattice plays a role in the stabilization of the material, a full understanding of such strain is lacking. Here, we develop a reactive force field (ReaxFF) for perovskites starting from our previous work for CsPbI\(_{3}\), and we extend this force field to CsPbBr\(_{3}\) and mixed CsPb(Br\(_{x}\)I\(_{1-x}\))\(_{3}\) compounds. This force field is used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study perovskite phase transitions and the internal ion dynamics associated with the phase transitions. We find that an increase of the Br content lowers the temperature at which the perovskite reaches a cubic structure. Specifically, by substituting Br for I, the smaller ionic radius of Br induces a strain in the lattice that changes the internal dynamics of the octahedra. Importantly, this effect propagates through the perovskite lattice ranging up to distances of 2 nm, explaining why small concentrations of Br in CsPb(Br\(_{x}\)I\(_{1-x}\))\(_{3}\) (\(x\) \( \leq \) 1/4) have a significant impact on the phase stability of mixed halide perovskites.},

The high conductivities of the S:CuI films validate the recently reported high figure of merit and motivate further exploration of dopants and alloy strategies with CuI to achieve high-performing p-type TCs.},

Photoluminescence peaks from these pre-segregated nanodomains, whose correlated intensity and wavelength variations signify the interactions of coupled quantum dots within a single CsPbBr\(_{1.2}\)I\(_{1.8}\) NC, can be simultaneously resolved at cryogenic temperature. Our findings thus point to a fascinating scenario in which a semiconductor nanostructure can be further divided into multiple quantum-light sources, the interaction and manipulation of which will promote novel photophysics to facilitate their potential applications in quantum information technologies.},

Interestingly, increasing the Pb content can not only entirely suppress the unwanted horizontal 2D phase in the film but also enhance the growth of vertical 2D phases, thus significantly improving the device performance and stability. It is suggested that an increase of the Pb content in the Pb--Sn mixed systems facilitates the incorporation of iso-butylammonium (iso-BA\(^{+}\)) ligands in vertically oriented perovskites because of the reduced lattice strain and increased interaction between the organic ligands and inorganic framework. Our work sheds light on the optimal conditions for fabricating stable and efficient 2D Pb--Sn mixed perovskite solar cells.},

We find that interstitials migrate faster than vacancies, due to the shorter migration paths of interstitials. Both types of defects migrate faster in CsPbI\(_{3}\) than in CsPbBr\(_{3}\).

Solution processing, the common fabrication method for MHPs, produces polycrystalline films with a wide variety of defects, such as point defects, surfaces, and grain boundaries. Although the optoelectronic effects of such defects have been widely studied, the evaluation of their impact on the long-term stability remains challenging. In particular, an understanding of the dynamics of degradation reactions at the atomistic scale is lacking. In this work, using reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of defects, in the forms of surfaces, surface defects, and grain boundaries, on the stability of the inorganic halide perovskite CsPbI\(_{3}\). Our simulations establish a stability trend for a variety of surfaces, which correlates well with the occurrence of these surfaces in experiments. We find that a perovskite surface degrades by progressively changing the local geometry of PbI\(_{x}\) octahedra from corner- to edge- to face-sharing. Importantly, we find that Pb dangling bonds and the lack of steric hindrance of I species are two crucial factors that induce degradation reactions. Finally, we show that the stability of these surfaces can be modulated by adjusting their atomistic details, by either creating additional point defects or merging them to form grain boundaries. While in general additional defects, particularly when clustered, have a negative impact on the material stability, some grain boundaries have a stabilizing effect, primarily because of the additional steric hindrance.},

Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the phase stability is strongly correlated to the displacement of ions in the perovskites. In the low temperature orthorhombic phase, directional movement of the Cs cations increases their distance to the surrounding halides, initiating a transition to the nonperovskite phase. However, once enough thermal energy is available, the increased Cs--halide distance can be compensated by increased halide fluctuations, resulting in a transition to the phase-stable tetragonal or cubic phases. Furthermore, we find the mixing of halides increases halide displacement over a significant range of temperatures, resulting in lower phase transition temperatures and therefore improved phase stability.},

When these mirrors are exposed to atomic hydrogen (H), it can permeate through Ru, leading to the formation of hydrogen-filled blisters on the mirrors. H has been shown to exhibit low solubility in bulk Ru, but the nature of H diffusion through Ru and its contribution to the mechanisms of blistering remain unknown. This work makes use of reactive molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of imperfections in a Ru film on the behavior of H. For the Ru/H system, a ReaxFF force field which reproduces structures and energies obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations was parametrized. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed with the newly developed force field to study the effect of tilt and twist grain boundaries on the overall diffusion behavior of H in Ru. Our simulations show that the tilt and twist grain boundaries provide energetically favorable sites for hydrogen atoms and act as sinks and highways for H. They therefore block H transport across their planes and favor diffusion along their planes. This results in the accumulation of hydrogen at the grain boundaries. The strong effect of the grain boundaries on hydrogen diffusion suggests tailoring the morphology of ruthenium thin films as a means to curb the rate of hydrogen permeation.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) shows a decrease with increasing luminance ("roll-off"). One of the contributions to the roll-off is triplet--triplet annihilation (TTA). TTA is the process of energy transfer from one triplet exciton to another, after which the excited exciton decays nonradiatively to the lowest triplet state. In this study, the TTA-rate is measured for a large number of emissive materials consisting of a small concentration of phosphorescent "guest" molecules, with emission colors across the entire visible range, embedded in various host materials. It is found that the TTA-rate does not only depend on the direct interaction rate between the excitons on the guest molecules, but also on the difference in triplet energy \(\Delta E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the host and guest molecules: when \(\Delta E_{\mathrm{T}}\) is smaller than about 0.20 eV, diffusion of excitons via the host molecules leads to a significant enhancement of the TTA-rate. By varying the guest concentration and using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the roles of the direct interaction, guest-mediated diffusion, and host-mediated diffusion are disentangled.},
