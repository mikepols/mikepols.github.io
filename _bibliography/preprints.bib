  abstract = {Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA\(_{2}\)Sn\(_{x}\)Pb\(_{1-x}\)I\(_{4}\) (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA\(_{2}\)SnI\(_{4}\) are substantially more chiral than in MBA\(_{2}\)PbI\(_{4}\), especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.},

  abstract = {Phonons in chiral crystal structures can acquire a circular polarization, becoming chiral themselves. Chiral phonons carry a spin angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to the electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites comprise a class of direct band gap semiconductors that can easily be forced into a chiral structure by incorporating chiral organic cations into the crystal. The degree of chirality can be tuned by modifying the organic cations. We reveal chiral phonons in such 2D perovskites, using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields based on density functional theory calculations. We find that particularly the low energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework of the perovskites, are chiral. In the presence of a temperature gradient, a substantial angular momentum density can be induced, which is measurable in experiment.},
