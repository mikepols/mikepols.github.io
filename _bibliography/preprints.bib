  abstract = {Phonons in chiral crystal structures can acquire a circular polarization, becoming chiral themselves. Chiral phonons carry a spin angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to the electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites comprise a class of direct band gap semiconductors that can easily be forced into a chiral structure by incorporating chiral organic cations into the crystal. The degree of chirality can be tuned by modifying the organic cations. We reveal chiral phonons in such 2D perovskites, using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields based on density functional theory calculations. We find that particularly the low energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework of the perovskites, are chiral. In the presence of a temperature gradient, a substantial angular momentum density can be induced, which is measurable in experiment.},

  abstract = {Halide perovskite optoelectronic devices suffer from chemical degradation and current-voltage hysteresis induced by migration of highly mobile charged defects. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI\(_{3}\) as a case study, we develop machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI\(_{3}\). We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.},
