My research lies at the intersection of Materials Science, High-Performance Computing, and Machine Learning, with a focus on the dynamical behavior of complex material systems. At [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), I study phonons in quantum paraelectric materials under the supervision of [Nicola Spaldin](https://theory.mat.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTc3MjY0.TGlzdC8yNDIzLDExMDc5MzA0OTc=.html).

Previously, I developed interatomic potentials to investigate ion and lattice dynamics in various perovskites at [Eindhoven University of Technology \(TU/e\)](https://www.tue.nl/en/). My work addressed anharmonic coupling during a short postdoc with [Dominik Juraschek](https://www.jurascheklab.com/) and ion migration, material degradation, and structural/dynamic chirality during my PhD, co-supervised by [Shuxia Tao](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/shuxia-tao) and [Sofía Calero](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/sofia-calero).

I hold a double degree in Physics and Chemistry (BSc and MSc) from TU/e, specializing in Computational Materials Science. My academic background includes research and teaching roles, as well as experience as a Scientific Software Developer at [Software for Chemistry & Materials \(SCM\)](https://www.scm.com/).
