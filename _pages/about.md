My research interests encompass Materials Science, High-Performance Computing, and Machine-Learning, which I apply to investigate the dynamic behavior of complex material systems. During my PhD, I specialized in developing interatomic potentials to explore the ion, phase, and lattice dynamics of halide perovskites. The studied topics range from ion migration and material degradation to structural and dynamic (read: phonon) chirality, this work was carried out in the [Materials Simulation & Modeling \(MSM\)](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/materials-simulation-modelling) group under supervision of [Shuxia Tao](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/shuxia-tao) and [Sof√≠a Calero](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/sofia-calero).

My academic background spans both Physics and Chemistry, with a double degree at the BSc and MSc levels from [Eindhoven University of Technology \(TU/e\)](https://www.tue.nl/en/), during which I focused on Computational Materials Science. Throughout my studies, I held various research and academic roles, including Research Assistant positions in the [Materials Simulation & Modeling \(MSM\)](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/materials-simulation-modelling) group and the [Molecular Materials & Nanosystems \(M2N\)](https://www.m2ngroup.nl/) group, investigating topics such as halide perovskites and OLEDs. Additionally, I worked as a Scientific Software Developer at [Software for Chemistry & Materials \(SCM\)](https://www.scm.com/) and served as a Teaching Assistant, gaining diverse experience in both research and education.
